# Customer Segmentationn Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Customer Segmentation Project! This project is a machine learning endeavor that uses K-Means clustering to form groups of similar customers. The core of this project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from [Kaggle's Mall Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python). It includes features of the customers like the gender, age, annual income, etc.

## Model
We use K-Means clustering for the customer segmentation. The use of the model and tuning are demonstrated in the notebook.

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook are installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/alfredh2/CustomerSegmentation.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned repository.
4. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Notebook
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open the `CustomerSegmentation.ipynb` notebook.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to see the analysis and model predictions.


## Results
The notebook includes a detailed analysis of model performance and accuracy metrics. We compare different models and discuss the best-performing model for this dataset.
